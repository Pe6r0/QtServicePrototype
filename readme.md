This code is for a a RewardsService based Application where the eligibility service hasn't been implemented yet.

It was developed in Windows in Visual Studio 2022 (but can be built anywhere with cmake 3.1).

Using a modern version of VS, to build/run just open this repo as a new folder and right click CMakeLists.txt to configure. 

Then setup CMakeLists.txt as a startup project and launch.

Hadn't had the opportunity to use QTest before so apologies if code there is ignoring better approaches, especially w.r.t. how it handles signaling.
